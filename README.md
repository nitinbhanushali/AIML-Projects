# AIML-Projects
Projects I completed as a part of Great Learning's PGP - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

## Projects done
**1. Statistical Learning**
   - Covers Descriptive Statistics, Probability & Conditional Probability, Hypothesis Testing, Inferential Statistics, Probability Distributions, Types of distribution and Binomial, Poisson & Normal distribution.

**2. Supervised Machine Learning**
   - Covers Multiple Variable Linear regression, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifiers, Multiple regression, K-NN classification, Support vector machines

**3. Ensemble Techniques**
   - Covers Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forests, Boosting
 - Leveraged customer information of bank marketing campaigns to predict whether a customer will subscribe to term deposit or not. Different classification algorithms like Decision tree, Logistic Regression were used. Ensemble techniques like Random forest were used to further improve the classification results.

**4. Unsupervised Machine Learning**
   - Covers K-means clustering, High-dimensional clustering, Hierarchical clustering, Dimension Reduction-PCA4
- Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification

**5. Feature Engineering Techniques**
   - Covers Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Exploration and Selection Techniques, Hyperparameter Tuning
- Used feature exploration and selection technique to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used regression models like decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and grid search were used to tune the parameters for the best model performance.

**6. Recommendation Systems**
   - Covers Introduction to Recommendation systems, Popularity based model, Hybrid models, Content based recommendation system, Collaborative filtering (User similarity & Item similarity)
        - Project involved building recommendation systems for Amazon products. A popularity-based model and a collaborative filtering filtering models were used and evaluated to recommend top-10 product for a user.

**7. Neural Networks**
   - Covers Gradient Descent, Batch Normalization, Hyper parameter tuning, Tensor Flow & Keras for Neural Networks & Deep Learning, Introduction to Perceptron & Neural Networks, Activation and Loss functions, Deep Neural Networks
- SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.

**8. Computer Vision**
   - Covers Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks, Convolution, Pooling, Padding & its mechanisms, Transfer Learning, Forward propagation & Backpropagation for CNNs, CNN architectures like AlexNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet & ResNet
- Recognize, identify and classify faces within images using CNN and image recognition algorithms. In this hands-on project, the goal is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.

**9. Advanced Computer Vision**
   - Covers Semantic segmentation, Siamese Networks, YOLO, Object & face recognition using techniques above
- Face recognition deals with Computer Vision a discipline of Artificial Intelligence and uses techniques of image processing and deep learning. The objective of this project is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.

**10. Statistical NLP (Natural Language Processing)**
   - Covers Bag of Words Model, POS Tagging, Tokenization, Word Vectorizer, TF-IDF, Named Entity Recognition, Stop Words
- The objective of this project is to build a text classification model that analyses the customer's sentiments based on their reviews in the IMDB database. The model uses a complex deep learning model to build an embedding layer followed by a classification algorithm to analyze the sentiment of the customers.

**11. Sequential NLP (Natural Language Processing)**
   - Covers Introduction to Sequential data, Vanishing & Exploding gradients in RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs (Gated recurrent unit), Case study: Sentiment analysis, RNNs and its mechanisms, Time series analysis, LSTMs with attention mechanism, Case study: Machine Translation
- The goal of this hands-on project is to analyse the headlines of the articles from news sources and detect whether they are sarcastic or not.
